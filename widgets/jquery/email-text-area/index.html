					<b>Skin in the game</b>
					<br/><br/>
					While famous IoT companies look for sustainability in development, the IoT startups bet on disruption.
					A new IoT application must impress an audience with both affordability and usability.
					It can show the way how to do something better, achieve something faster, and make life easier after all.
					The majority of top IoT startups do not reinvent the wheel — they improve user experience with their IoT products and services.
					And this is the very essence of risk in innovations to offer addressing issues from a different angle.
					Nevertheless, the basic principle of evolution (as well as of capitalism) remains here to stay: the fittest will survive.
					Let’s see through which business ideas the following 7 best IoT startups cope with challenges of putting their skin in the game.

					<b>Startups will be startups</b>
					<br/><br/>
					The given Top 7 IoT startups are different in both their specializations and ambitions.
					Some of them bet on quite narrow domain-specific IoT solutions, the others strive to cover as many divergent IoT sub-sectors as possible.
					But what combines all of them in a cohort distinctive from a corporate “business-as-usual” paradigm is an ability to take the risk of being disruptive.
					The IoT startupers propagate innovations capable of making the end customers’ life easier through various solutions making their businesses
					more manageable and thus more beneficial. Just the satisfied (or unsatisfied) customer expectations determine a market share of one or
					another IoT startup in a rapidly changing data-driven economy.
					The risk of failure will always remain as well as those brave guys who can take the risk.
					And the technological development will keep moving forward until startups remain startups.
